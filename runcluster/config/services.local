# List of services to run.  Each line is <name>=<service-jar>, where <name>
# is one of cfg, repo, poller, mdx, mdq, and <service-jar> is either a path
# to the corresponding uber jar (absolute or relative to the
# laaws-dev-scripts/runcluster directory), or mvn:<artifact>, where
# <artifact> is groupId:artifactId:version .  In the latter case mvn will
# be invoked to obtain the jar.
