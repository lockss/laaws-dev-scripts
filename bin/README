Useful scripts for LOCKSS 2.0 and LOCKSS plugin development

runservice:

  Runs a single LOCKSS service.  Invoke in the source tree of a LOCKSS
  service, or use -d to specify such a dir.  The project must already have
  been built with 'mvn package'.

  To start Config Service, run

    runservice -j -p <props-url>

  from anywhere in the laaws-configservice source tree.  <props-url> is the
  URL of the lockss.xml on your props server.

  To start all other services, run

    runservice -j -c localhost

  from anywhere in that service's source tree.

  Use ^C to exit a service.

  For a minimal LOCKSS cluster, run runservice in laaws-configservice,
  laaws-repository-service and laaws-poller.  For metadata extraction and
  retrieval capabilities, add laaws-metadataextractor and
  laaws-metadataservice.
